# Workbench Validation

These assets validate the same 18-tool Workbench surface exported by
`crates/nokv-agent` and served by `nokv mcp`. They do not define a
runtime-specific metadata layout, capability alias, migration helper, or
filesystem frontend.

The checked-in integration assets are deliberately small:

- `workbench_contract.py` verifies an MCP `tools/list` response against the
  exact Rust-owned schema at
  `crates/nokv-agent/workbench_contract_schema.json`.
- `workbench_contract_test.py` tests normalization and exact surface matching.
- `live_workbench.py` provisions one root, starts one explicit metadata
  owner and the flat `nokv mcp` command, then records a real
  scientific reconstruction workflow through all 18 tools.
- `live_workbench_test.py` checks exact coverage/order, flat commands,
  secret redaction, dry-run evidence, and fail-closed qualification.
- `start_rustfs.sh` starts the optional local S3-compatible artifact backend.

Build and validate the product directly:

```bash
cargo build -p nokv --bin nokv
cargo test --workspace
python3 scripts/workbench/workbench_contract_test.py
python3 scripts/workbench/live_workbench_test.py
```

Register the built binary in any MCP-compatible Agent runtime as a stdio MCP
command:

```text
/absolute/path/to/nokv <root, route, object, and workbench options> mcp
```

The deployment must provide one persisted `RootId` placement, its
`LogicalShardId`, current placement generation and owner epoch, a reachable
metadata owner, and S3-compatible artifact credentials. Unknown or mixed
metadata schemas are rejected; the sole marker is `nokv_workspace`.

## Live Workbench evidence

Dry-run validates the redacted command graph and exact 18-tool coverage without
claiming that any dependency ran:

```bash
python3 scripts/workbench/live_workbench.py \
  --dry-run \
  --evidence-dir target/workbench-live/evidence/dry-run
```

A live run consumes already-running etcd and S3-compatible services.
Credentials may be supplied with `NOKV_LIVE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`NOKV_LIVE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; evidence hashes and redacts secrets.

```bash
python3 scripts/workbench/live_workbench.py \
  --build \
  --root-id 11111111111111111111111111111111 \
  --logical-shard-id 22222222222222222222222222222222 \
  --etcd-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --object-endpoint http://127.0.0.1:9000 \
  --object-bucket nokv-workbench-live \
  --metadata-mode create \
  --metadata-dir target/workbench-live/metadata/live-01 \
  --evidence-dir target/workbench-live/evidence/live-01
```

`--metadata-mode reopen` is currently a negative qualification path, not a
supported standalone restart: local-WAL bootstrap refuses successor ownership
until checkpoint/log recovery and fsck are verified. The harness always calls
`nokv provision`, starts `nokv serve` with exactly one of `--metadata-create`
or `--metadata-reopen`, and starts
`nokv ... --workbench-root /agents/{agent}/wb mcp`. The scientific step uses the
explicit `materialize` and `collect` commands; its local sandbox is not a NoKV
namespace. Keep the configured Workbench root stable across restarts because
canonical v1 manifest presentation paths are replay-bound; `RootId`, not this
display root, remains the storage/routing identity.

The deterministic evidence directory contains `plan.json`, exact paired
requests/responses in `mcp-transcript.jsonl`, `processes.jsonl` and process
logs, build/config facts in `environment.json`, validated schema evidence in
`contract.json`, and explicit statuses in `qualification.json`.

Exit status `3` means a required live dependency is absent and the workflow is
`NOT QUALIFIED`, never a pass. Exit status `2` means a configured live boundary
violated an assertion. A successful live run marks the 18-tool workflow
`PASS`, while overall Gate 0 remains `NOT QUALIFIED`: this bounded harness does
not wait for the minimum one-day snapshot lease to expire and reach `reaped`.

Live durability, failover, object-provider, and end-to-end Workbench
qualification must be reported separately according to
`docs/development/workspace-acceptance.md`. Unit tests or schema checks are not
substitutes for those gates.
